        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>My name is Caiden Libutti, and I am currently pursuing a degree in Business Administration. I chose this path because I have always been interested in leadership, management, and building things that last. Over time, I realized that business is the foundation of almost everything, and learning how to run an organization effectively is a skill I want to master. This has become even more important as I take on a major role in a large, government-contracted telecommunications company. Stepping into a leadership position at such a young age has pushed me to grow quickly, make responsible decisions, and learn how to communicate clearly with teams, clients, and partners.</p>

        <p>Outside of business, I have a wide range of interests that reflect who I am. Photography is one of my favorite ways to express creativity. I enjoy capturing moments, experimenting with lighting, and finding unique perspectives. Music is another big part of my life, whether I am listening, exploring new artists, or using it to stay focused. I also have a strong interest in cars, from modifying and improving my own to learning about performance and engineering. Collecting items that inspire me or hold sentimental value is something I enjoy as well, and it has become part of how I express my personality.</p>

        <p>All of these interests come together to shape how I see the world. I am focused on growth, creativity, and building a successful future, both academically and professionally.</p>

        <h2>Learning Narrative</h2>
        <p>When I started this English class, I thought it would be the same type of class I was used to from high school. I expected regular essays, simple assignments, and the usual routine of writing, turning something in, and moving on to the next task. I definitely did not expect to build a full website or create a portfolio where everything needed to be organized and presented professionally. At first, I was unsure about how all of these pieces would fit together, especially the website, because that felt like something completely outside my comfort zone. Slowly, I began to understand that the class was designed to help us learn different ways of communicating and to show how writing can work in more modern formats, not just on a Word document.</p>

        <p>One of the biggest learning moments happened when I wrote my memoir. It forced me to slow down and think about why I was telling that specific story and how I wanted someone else to experience it. I had to think about the beginning of the memory, how it felt in the moment, and why it still matters to me now. Writing it helped me see how structure and emotion work together and how choosing the right details can make a story more meaningful. Around the same time, we talked about philosophers and how people form beliefs, personality traits, and values. Even though it was not what I expected in an English class, it made me think differently about how readers understand a message. It showed me that writing is connected to how people think, interpret, and react.</p>

        <p>As the semester went on, the website project became one of the things I learned the most from. I had never created a website before, so learning how to design it, organize my writing, and connect everything in a clear way taught me a skill I know I will use in the future. It helped me see how presentation affects communication. For example, a piece of writing can look completely different depending on how it is formatted, how easy it is to read, and how it is placed on the page. I realized that professional communication is not just about what you say but also how you deliver it.</p>

        <p>By the end of this class, I could see how all of these different assignments connected to each other. I improved my writing by learning to revise more carefully, focus on clarity, and think about audience and purpose. These skills will help me in my Business Administration degree and in the construction industry where communication matters in every part of the job. I will need to write clear emails, explain ideas to clients, complete paperwork, and present information in a professional way. The website experience will also help me if I need to build a site for a business in the future.</p>

        <p>Looking back, I learned far more than I expected. This class made me a stronger and more confident communicator, and the skills I gained will stay with me long after the semester ends.</p>
