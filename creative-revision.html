        <h1>Creative Revision</h1>
        <p>Transforming my memoir into poetry to foreground emotion and memory.</p>
      </div>

        <h2>Preface</h2>
        <p>For my creative revision, I chose to transform my memoir into three poems. This created a completely new rhetorical situation for both the audience and the purpose. Instead of speaking to an academic audience that expects a clear and structured narrative, I am now writing for readers who connect through emotion, imagery, and interpretation. The purpose shifted from telling a detailed story to expressing the feelings behind the experience in a more artistic form. Poetry allows me to communicate fear, confusion, and growth through short lines, symbolic moments, and intentional rhythm.</p>
        <p>The original memoir focused on what happened, including the sequence of events and the context of that night. These poems focus on memory and emotion rather than step by step storytelling. They highlight how the moment felt, how it changed me, and how certain images still stay with me. I chose poetry because traumatic memories often return in flashes, not full scenes. Poetry captures that broken pattern and the way certain images remain sharp long after the moment is gone.</p>
        <p>I revised the original project by selecting key details and turning them into imagery that represents fear, loss, and reflection. I kept the central elements of the car, the night, and the sound of the gunshot, but I changed the form to make the emotional impact the main focus. I considered turning the memoir into a short script or dramatic monologue, but poetry felt like the format that matched the subject most honestly.</p>

        <h2>Poem 1: Through the Window</h2>
        <p>Streetlights hum against the dark, yellow circles trembling on wet pavement.<br>
        Grandpa speaks somewhere beyond the glass, a low voice with sharp edges.<br>
        I draw small shapes on the fogged window, pretending I do not see a sudden movement in the shadows.<br>
        The sound rips through the night, and everything folds into silence.<br>
        I drop to the floor of the car, knees pulled tightly to my chest, heart beating harder than the single shot that changed everything.</p>

        <h2>Poem 2: Echoes in the Car</h2>
        <p>The seat smells like leather and dust.<br>
        My fingerprints rest lightly on the cold door handle.<br>
        I wait for his knock, the one he promised, the one that never comes.<br>
        Sirens rise in the distance.<br>
        Red and blue colors flash across the window and paint a world that no longer feels familiar.<br>
        The door opens.<br>
        They find me, but the part of me that trusted is already gone.</p>

        <h2>Poem 3: Lessons in the Quiet</h2>
        <p>Years later, I still hear him at night.<br>
        His laugh.<br>
        His steady voice saying, “Stay here.”<br>
        I learned to live in the quiet space between heartbeats.<br>
        I learned to trust only what stands in full light.<br>
        Fear taught me honesty.<br>
        Pain taught me choice.<br>
        And every time I close my eyes, I promise both him and myself that I will never step into darkness without knowing who waits there.</p>
