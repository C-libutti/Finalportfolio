      <h1>Project 2 — Photography Discourse Community</h1>

      <section class="project-intro">
        <h2>Photography: Capturing Life Through Light</h2>
        <p>I became involved in the photography community when I borrowed my friend's camera during high school. What started as a way to document everyday life quickly became a passion for storytelling through images. The first time I adjusted the settings for myself on manual mode, I realized how much control I had over how a moment could feel. Photography felt like a voice without words, allowing me to express emotion through lighting, texture, and composition.</p>

        <h3>Why Photography Matters</h3>
        <p>Photography is important to me because it teaches patience and attention to detail. Each photo is a lesson in seeing the world differently, finding beauty in simple things like reflections on glass or shadows on pavement. Sharing my photos with my group of photography friends and receiving feedback has helped me grow technically and creatively. This community inspires constant learning, whether it's mastering post-processing and color grading in Lightroom or experimenting with the rule of thirds to improve composition.</p>

        <h3>The Heart of the Community</h3>
        <p>To outsiders, the photography discourse community may seem technical, full of difficult concepts like "exposure triangle" or "depth of field," but at its heart, it's about connection. Photographers use visual language to communicate emotions, preserve memories, and spark empathy. We share tips in forums, collaborate on shoots, and critique each other's work to refine our craft.</p>

        <h3>Our Shared Values</h3>
        <p>Our community values creativity, authenticity, and storytelling. Whether it's a street photographer capturing spontaneous city life or a portrait artist shaping light to reveal character, every image reflects our shared mission: to see the extraordinary in the ordinary.</p>

        <h2>Language of the Photography Community</h2>
        <p>Photography has its own vocabulary—terms that photographers use to describe techniques, tools, and concepts. Understanding this language is essential for engaging with the community and improving your craft.</p>

        <h3>Key Photography Terms</h3>
        <dl class="terms-list">
          <dt><strong>Aperture</strong></dt>
          <dd>Aperture controls how much light enters the lens. A low f-stop (like f/1.8) creates a blurry background, while a high f-stop keeps the whole image sharp.</dd>

          <dt><strong>ISO</strong></dt>
          <dd>ISO measures the camera's sensitivity to light. Low ISO keeps images clean, while high ISO brightens dark scenes but can add grain.</dd>

          <dt><strong>Shutter Speed</strong></dt>
          <dd>Shutter speed determines how long the camera captures light. Fast shutter speeds freeze motion; slow speeds create motion blur or light trails.</dd>

          <dt><strong>Rule of Thirds</strong></dt>
          <dd>A composition guideline that divides the frame into a grid. Placing the subject along the lines or intersections creates a more balanced, appealing photo.</dd>

          <dt><strong>Post-Processing</strong></dt>
          <dd>Editing photos after taking them. Photographers adjust lighting, color, sharpness, and more to improve or stylize an image.</dd>
