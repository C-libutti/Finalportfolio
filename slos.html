      <h1>Student Learning Outcomes (SLOs)</h1>

      <div class="reading-panel">
        <h2>1. Writing as a Process</h2>
        <p>During project 1, I used multiple steps in my writing process, including prewriting, revising, and reflecting. I began by writing freely to get my emotions on the page, then returned to organize and edit so the story would flow more naturally. Revising helped me see how structure and tone could shape the reader's emotional response. Collaborating with feedback, even if limited, helped me notice what needed to be changed or revised. This process showed me that writing is not about getting it perfect the first time, but about building meaning through reflection and change.</p>

        <h2>2. Rhetorical Situation and Genre</h2>
        <p>While writing my memoir, I had to think carefully about my audience and purpose. I wanted the story to keep its authentic and emotional aspect without overwhelming the reader. Understanding the genre of a personal narrative helped me choose the right tone, details, and pacing to make the piece powerful but not encumbering. I analyzed how different writing choices could create empathy and help readers understand what I experienced. This awareness taught me how to shape my writing to fit its purpose and connect deeply with those reading it.</p>

        <h2>3. Writing as a Social Act</h2>
        <p>In Project 2, I met this SLO by exploring how photography operates as a real discourse community built on shared communication and collaboration. While researching photographers, I learned how they exchange feedback, teach each other techniques, and use a shared vocabulary to communicate ideas clearly. Creating my website required me to think socially, because I had to imagine an outside audience who knew nothing about photography and explain the community in a way that welcomed them in. I also used online resources, articles, and reels created by other photographers, which showed how knowledge in this community is passed along socially rather than individually. Designing my site with simple explanations, relatable examples, and helpful visuals helped me connect with that audience more effectively. Overall, this project showed me how writing becomes stronger when I think about how communities communicate and how my work fits into that conversation.</p>

        <h2>4. Grammar and Usage</h2>
        <p>Throughout the semester, I improved my fluency in Standard Written English by practicing clearer sentence structure, more organized paragraphs, and stronger overall flow in my writing. Each assignment, from discussion posts to drafts of my memoir and website, helped me notice habits in my writing that needed adjustment, such as run-on sentences or missing transitions. As I revised, I became more confident in choosing precise wording and creating smoother, more readable explanations. I also learned how different registers of language serve different purposes: narrative language in my memoir, technical vocabulary in my photography project, and more academic tone in reflections. Paying attention to grammar and usage made my writing feel more intentional and professional, especially when addressing outside audiences. Overall, the semester helped me become more consistent and thoughtful in how I use language across different types of writing.</p>

        <h2>5. Research</h2>
        <p>For Project 2, I met the research SLO by gathering information from multiple photography sources, including articles, online guides, and educational reels. I used this research to better understand the vocabulary, values, and behaviors of photographers so I could explain them accurately on my website. I summarized important information in my own words and incorporated it ethically without copying or relying too heavily on any single source. Research also helped me learn how different photographers think about creativity, technical skill, and community, which influenced how I structured each page of my site. By combining my own perspective with outside sources, I created a more complete explanation of the photography community. This project showed me how research strengthens writing by helping me understand a topic deeply and present it responsibly.</p>
